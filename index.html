        <p>&emsp;While exploring a couple pages about free online tools for practicing front-end development, I came across <a
            href="https://50projects50days.com">this wonderful course</a> on Udemy and decided to take on the challenge
        to feel more confident with my skills.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Although I have found <a href="https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days?tab=readme-ov-file">the
            repository containing all 50 projects</a>, I felt like trying to replicate the 50 pages displayed through
        observation alone felt more in line with my learning habits.</p>
        <p>&emsp;I am still working my way through the projects and will add them to the list bellow as I do so.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Once again, these projects were replicated from the Udemy course linked above, I take no credit beyond my
        ability to replicate them from the data I see in my browser's element inspection tool.</p>
